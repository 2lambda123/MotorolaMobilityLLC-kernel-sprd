Spreadtrum PCIe controller DT description

Spreadtrum PCIe host controller is based on Designware PCI core.
It shares common functions with PCIe Designware core driver and inherits
common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pci.txt.

Additional properties are described here:

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "sprd,pcie" for RC
	       Should be "sprd,pcie-ep" for EP
 - num-lanes as specified in ../designware-pcie.txt

HOST MODE
=========
 - reg: Should contain dbi, config registers location and length.
 - reg-names: Must include the following entries:
	      "dbi": controller configuration registers;
	      "config": PCIe configuration space registers.
 - #address-cells,
   #size-cells,
   #interrupt-cells,
   device_type,
   ranges,
   interrupt-map-mask,
   interrupt-map: as specified in ../designware-pcie.txt

DEVICE MODE
===========
 - reg : Three register ranges as listed in the reg-names property
 - reg-names: "dbi" for the standard configuration registers as
		they are locally accessed within the DIF CS space
	       "dbi2" for the standard configuration registers as
		they are locally accessed within the DIF CS2 space
	       "addr_space" used to map remote RC address space
 - num-ib-windows: number of inbound address translation windows
 - num-ob-windows: number of outbound address translation windows

Example:
	pcie0@2b100000 {
		compatible = "sprd,pcie", "snps,dw-pcie";
		reg = <0x0 0x2b100000 0x0 0x2000>,
		      <0x2 0x00000000 0x0 0x2000>;
		reg-names = "dbi", "config";
		#address-cells = <3>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		device_type = "pci";
		ranges = <0x01000000 0x0 0x00000000 0x2 0x00002000 0x0 0x00010000
			  0x03000000 0x0 0x10000000 0x2 0x10000000 0x1 0xefffffff>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		bus-range = <0  15>;
		num-lanes = <1>;
		num-vectors = <256>;
		num-viewport = <8>;
	};

	pcie1@2b100000 {
		compatible = "sprd,pcie-ep", "snps,dw-pcie";
		reg = <0x0 0x2b100000 0x0 0x2000>,
		      <0x0 0x2b108000 0x0 0x2000>,
		      <0x2 0x00000000 0x2 0x00000000>;
		reg-names = "dbi", "dbi2","addr_space";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 55 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		num-lanes = <1>;
		num-ib-windows = <6>;
		num-ob-windows = <8>;
	};
