Spreadtrum PCIe controller DT description

Spreadtrum PCIe host controller is based on Designware PCI core.
It shares common functions with PCIe Designware core driver and inherits
common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pci.txt.

Additional properties are described here:

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "sprd,pcie" for RC
	       Should be "sprd,pcie-ep" for EP
 - num-lanes as specified in ../designware-pcie.txt

HOST MODE
=========
 - reg: Should contain dbi, config registers location and length.
 - reg-names: Must include the following entries:
	      "dbi": controller configuration registers;
	      "config": PCIe configuration space registers.
 - #address-cells,
   #size-cells,
   #interrupt-cells,
   device_type,
   ranges,
   interrupt-map-mask,
   interrupt-map: as specified in ../designware-pcie.txt

 - sprd,pcie-startup-syscons: the global registers of pcie when pcie startup.
			      each group syscon has 6 cells as follows:
	- phandle of pcie syscon for used for pcie host controller
	- the type of syscon:
          0ï¼š set/clear, use regmap_update_bits() to operate these registers
          1: not set/clear, use regmap_read() and regmap_write() to operate
             these registers
	- the delay value: the delay time (unit: ms) after the syscon is set
	- register: the register to be operated by the syscon
	- mask: the mask of the syscon register
	- value: the value to be set to the syscon register mask

DEVICE MODE
===========
 - reg : Three register ranges as listed in the reg-names property
 - reg-names: "dbi" for the standard configuration registers as
		they are locally accessed within the DIF CS space
	       "dbi2" for the standard configuration registers as
		they are locally accessed within the DIF CS2 space
	       "addr_space" used to map remote RC address space
 - num-ib-windows: number of inbound address translation windows
 - num-ob-windows: number of outbound address translation windows
