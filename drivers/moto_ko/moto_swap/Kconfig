	help
	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

config HYBRIDSWAP_ZRAM_WRITEBACK
       bool "Write back incompressible or idle page to backing device"
       depends on HYBRIDSWAP_ZRAM
       help
	 With incompressible page, there is no memory saving to keep it
	 in memory. Instead, write it out to backing device.
	 For this feature, admin should set up backing device via
	 /sys/block/zramX/backing_dev.

config HYBRIDSWAP_ZRAM_MEMORY_TRACKING
	bool "Track zRam block status"
	depends on HYBRIDSWAP_ZRAM && DEBUG_FS
	help
	  With this feature, admin can track the state of allocated blocks
	  of zRAM. Admin could see the information via
	  /sys/kernel/debug/zram/zramX/block_state.

	  Hybridswap is a intelligent memory management solution.

	default y
	depends on HYBRIDSWAP
	help
	  swapd is a kernel thread that reclaim anonymous pages in the
	  background. When the use of swap pages reaches the watermark
	  and the refault of anonymous pages is high, the content of
	  zram will exchanged to eswap by a certain percentage.

	  Say Y here if you want to use the hybridswap
	  as the backend device in ZRAM.
	  If unsure, say N here.
	  This module can't be compiled as a module,
	  the module is as one part of the ZRAM driver.

	default n
	help
	  Say Y here if you want to create asynchronous thread
	  for compress anon pages.
	  If unsure, say N here.
	  This feature will reduce the kswapd cpu load.
